Project Name: New York City Airbnb

Tool Used: Power BI,Python

The "New York City Airbnb" project is a comprehensive exploration of the New York City Airbnb dataset using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. This project aims to provide valuable insights into the NYC Airbnb market and showcase the power of data analysis and visualization in making data-driven decisions.

In the initial stage, Python is utilized to clean and preprocess the raw data, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data for analysis.

The dashboard features three slicers for filtering data based on the number of reviews, price, and room type. These slicers allow users to dynamically explore the data and gain insights.

Three cards display essential metrics - average price, average reviews, and maximum price, providing an at-a-glance view of key performance indicators for the Airbnb listings.

A clustered column chart showcases the maximum number of minimum nights required by neighbourhood group and room type, revealing booking trends and preferences for different accommodations.

A stacked column chart visualizes the maximum number of reviews received by neighbourhood group and room type, giving an understanding of guest feedback and popularity in various areas.

Map is used to display neighbourhood group and room type, presenting a spatial view of Airbnb properties across the city.

A stacked column chart is employed to showcase the maximum calculated_host_listings_count by neighbourhood group, highlighting the most active hosts and their presence in different neighbourhoods.

A donut chart is used to compare the maximum price among different room types, enabling users to discern pricing patterns.

A pie chart presents the average price of listings for each neighbourhood group, offering a quick comparison of pricing trends in various areas.

A scatter chart shows the relationship between reviews and price, helping users explore any correlation between price and guest satisfaction.

A stacked bar chart illustrates the maximum price of listings by neighbourhood group and room type, providing a comprehensive view of pricing variations.

Additionally, a table is included to present detailed data and allow users to access specific information.
